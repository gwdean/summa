Notes on *Introduction to Empirical Bayes* (Robinson-2017)

These are the key topics that Robinson covers in this book:

-   Beta Distribution
-   Empirical Bayes Estimation
-   Credible Intervals
-   Hypothesis Testing
-   False Discovery Rate Control
-   Bayesian A/B Testing
-   Beta Binomial Regression
-   Empirical Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling
-   Mixture Models
-   Expectation Maximization
-   The Multinomial
-   The Dirichlet
-   The Ebbr Package
-   Simulation
-   Simulating Replications

The motivation for this book, according to Robinson, is to provide an
intuitive explanation for a statistical concept that has not received
its proper attention.

*Empirical Bayes Methods* are tools for handling uncertainty across many
observations. Using a single case study – batting averages in baseball
statistics – Robinson teaches empirical Bayes methods for people who
need to understand and apply mathematical methods, but with a focus on
working with data as opposed to equations.

According to Robinson, the book originated as an answer to a
StackExchange question. From this question, a series of blog posts and a
narrative emerged, which was suitable to be put into a book format.
While much of the code in included in the basic test, much of the code,
especially the visualizations, are not. The full set of code examples
can be found in the following repository:

The initial question that trigger the series of posts that led to this
book is as follows. It is worth lingering over it for a bit, since this
sets the stage for what follows:

“What is the intuition behind \[the\] Beta distribution?”
